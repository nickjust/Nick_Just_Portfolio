Portfolio of Machine Learning Projects by Nick Just


## [Computer Vision Project - R-CNN for object detection and motion tracking](https://nickjust.github.io/RCNN_object_detection/)

### Project overview 
* Applied detection and classification of moving objects (Computer Vision) using self-developed Deep Neural Networks (CNN, R-CNN)
* Self-generated and manually labeled dataset of the individual object to be identified 
* Implementation in Python using Tensorflow, Keras and OpenCV 
* Extension of the algorithm to recognise the object (remote controlled car) both in individual pictures and videos in order to track its movement
