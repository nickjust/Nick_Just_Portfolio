Portfolio of Machine Learning Projects by Nick Just


## Computer Vision Project - R-CNN for object detection and motion tracking
* Applied detection and classification of moving objects (Computer Vision) using self-developed Deep Neural Networks (CNN, R-CNN)
* Self-generated and manually labeled dataset of the individual object to be identified 
* Implementation in Python using Tensorflow, Keras and OpenCV 
* Extension of the algorithm to recognise the object (remote controlled car) both in individual pictures and videos in order to track its movement

## Natural Language Processing Project - Automatic Speech Recognition 
For this example project I built a ball classifier to identify balls from different sports. This could be useful for someone who is new to sports from a certain country. They could take a picture of a ball and an app could serve them some information about the history and rules of the game. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities. 

I was able to get the model to predict the sport of the ball with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning. For most of the cases this would meet the need of an end user of the app. To get these results I used transfer learning on a CNN trained on resnet34. This created time efficiencies and solid results. 




## DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT - SALES MANAGEMENT

### Project overview
* This projec explores different business metrics and how they can be displayed graphically to follow them
* I explore the relation between sales, budget, costumers and products
* We can obtain conclusions that will help us to make better marketing campaigns and improve profits
* The tools used are SQL server and Power BI

### Project overview
* An electronics store needs to increase its profits
* A KPI is found that will allow to increase profits at the lowest cost.
* Sales were evaluated by product, city, time and over time.
* This analysis was done on a database with 180,000 values using Excel only.


### Project overview
- We need to know which factors influence to give a loan
- We also need to look for any opportunity to increase the bank's assets.
- It was found that apart from income, family size is an important factor to give loans.
- The libraries used were pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and scipy.
